Choose the custom tls path if you have done the following:

- aquired your own domain name
- created tls certificates and a key for that domain
- created a CNAME entry in a public DNS to point your domain to the techzone cluster
- succesfully pinged the techzone cluster using your new domain name

Otherwise choose the techzone tls path.
